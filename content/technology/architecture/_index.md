## How is the architecture documented?
The [non functional and functional requirements](requirements) have given input to which devops and runtime [capabilities](capabilities) 
that are needed in the solutions. It also have given input which type of [components](components) that are needed to implement the capabilities.

The [Architectural Principles](principles) and [Architectural Patterns](patterns) have been
decided based on requirements and other goals with the new solutions.
These Principles and patterns have been deciding factors in how the [components](components) implement the required [capabilities](capabilities).
